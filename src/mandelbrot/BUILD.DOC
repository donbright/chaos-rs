Building MAND:

Only one variable in the makefile might need to be changed; that
is LB, which should point to the Turbo-C libraries. 

The following tools were used:

Turbo C++ (TCC++) version 1.00
TASM version 2.0
TLINK version 3.0
Turbo MAKE version 3.0
LHARC version 1.13c


So: To build MAND, modify "makefile" so that LB points to
the right place, and just say "MAKE". The resulting file
will be called MANDxx.EXE, where "xx" is the version number.
To build a sourcekit, "make srckit"; to build a beta release 
package, with notes, say "make beta"; to make everything from
scratch, say "make all".
