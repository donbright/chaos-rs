This is the sourcekit for MAGNETS.

Building MAGNETS:

OPUS MAKE is used to build MAG. The attached makefile is used.
Make sure your path is set to \tc\bin!

The following tools were used:

Turbo C (TCC) version 2.01
TASM version 1.0
TLINK version 2.0
OPUS MAKE version 5.0.2
Lharc version 1.13c


So: To build MAG, just say "MAKE". The resulting file
will be called MAGxx.EXE, where "xx" is the version number.
To build a sourcekit, "make srckit"; to build a beta release
package, with notes, say "make beta"; to make everything from
scratch, say "make all".
